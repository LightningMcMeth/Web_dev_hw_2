1. Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to
the State.
2. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can
on no account be neglected.
3. The art of war, then, is governed by five
constant factors, to be taken into account in one’s deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions
obtaining in the field.
4. These are:
(1) The Moral Law;
(2) Heaven;
(3) Earth;
(4) The Commander;
(5) Method and discipline.
5,6. The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow
him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.
7. Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times
and seasons.
